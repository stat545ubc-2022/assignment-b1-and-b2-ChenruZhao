# b2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of b2 is to create a function that can help get the median value in each group of a tibble.

## Installation

You can install the development version of b2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-ChenruZhao/b2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(b2)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r examples}
median_in_group(palmerpenguins::penguins, body_mass_g, island, TRUE)

median_in_group(palmerpenguins::penguins, bill_length_mm, species, FALSE)

median_in_group(palmerpenguins::penguins, year, island, TRUE)
```
